# Windows-RenamePCAndJoinDomain

Get input for hostname, domain, and admin account to rename device and join domain

Made to copy-paste into other scripts but does technically work on its own, albeit not the prettiest interface.
You'd be better off creating a nice interface with WPF and importing it.
